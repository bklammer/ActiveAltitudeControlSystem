%     Simple moments of inertia calculator for a Rocket. The composite moment 
% of inertia is calculated from an unlimited number of smaller component masses
% that can be classified s either a "cylinder", a "tube" or a point mass 
% ("pm").
%     Input arguments must be a cell array the first cell of which contains a 
% string identifying the array as either "cylinder" "tube" or "pm", the 
% second cell is a vector that contains the relevant masses and dimensions 
% required to calculate the moments of inertia.
% 
% Cylinder
%     The cylinder input is a four element vecto containing: [Mass,Radius,
% Length,Distance from centre of mass (Xcm)]
%
% e.g. {'cylinder'}{[M,R,L,X]}
% 
% Tube
%     The tube input is a five element vector: [Mass,Rad(inner),Rad(outer),
% Length,Xcm]
%
% e.g. {'tube'}{[M,Ri,Ro,L,X]}
% 
% Point Mass
%     The point mass input is a three vector array: [Mass,Xcm(long),
% Xcm(rad)]
%
% e.g. {'pm'}{[M,Xr,Xl]}
% 
%     The assumption is that the axis of tubes and cylinders are coincedent 
% with the rocket axis. Point masses can be anywhere but for calculation 
% longitudinal moments of inertia they will be assumed to lie on the rocket 
% axis, this assumtion is valid assuming the rocket is long and thin, and the 
% point mass is not very close to the centre of mass.
% 
%     The output is three components of moments of inertia for cartesian axis
% whose z axis is alighned with the axis of the rocket.
