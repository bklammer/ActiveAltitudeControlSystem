function Xcm=axi_com(varargin);

% This function calculates the distance of the centre of mass of an 
% axisymetric object (like a rocket) from some reference point (like the tip 
% of a rocket nose). The inputs are any number of two element vectors 
% representing point masses. the structure of the vectors are [M,X], where
% M is the mass and X is the distance of the point mass from the reference 
% point.

for i=1:nargin;
    M(i)=varargin{i}(1);
    X(i)=varargin{i}(2);
end

MX=M.*X;

Xcm=sum(MX)/sum(M);
