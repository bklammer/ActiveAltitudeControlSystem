%This function builds a table containing all the important variables in a
%rocket simulation against time. The function can be run after any of the
%rocket flight simulations have been run and it builds the table using the
%output data from the rocket simulations in the workspace.
%The inputs for the function are as follows:
%(INPUT,INPUT4,altpd,RL,Ra,Rbearing,(igdelay),tt,z)
%Where
%"INTAB" is the input rocket data, "INTAB4" is the atmospheric data input
%table ,"altpd" is the altitude of main parachute deployment for a dual
%deploy system. If the rocket is not dual deploy then a value must still be
%specified the value won't affect the output of the model but 0 is a good
%choice. "RL" is the length of the rocket lauch rail in (m),"Ra" is the
%angle of the launch rail from the vertical in degrees, "Rbearing" is the
%bearing the rail is pointion from North (degrees), "igdelay" is an
%optional variable if the input flight is the second stage of a two stage
%rocket this variable is the ignition delay from sepatation in seconds,"tt"
%is the array containing time values from the flight simulation output, "z"
%is the corresponding simulation output data table containing position and
%momentum data.
%The outputs are are a cell array containing lables for the columns of the
%data table, and the data table itself.
